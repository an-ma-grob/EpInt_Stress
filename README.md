# EpInt_Stress

You can find the data I worked with in the "Data.xlsx" and reproduce my analyses and figures in the "Analyses_RScript.R". 

The raw log files from the narrative insight task can be found in the ZIP "Logs.zip".

For my fMRI analyses I used the "Preprocessing_Pipeline.m", "First_Level_Mismatch" (for the link phase analyses), "First_Level_Univariate" (for the pre- and post changes), 
"First_Level_RSA" (for the RSA analysis). 

To further reproduce my RSA results, you can use my RDMs in the "RDMs.zip" and "Get_Averaged_RSA_Results.m".
To get the RDMs I used "ROI_RSA_AMG.m" as well as the files in the "rsatoolbox.zip".
