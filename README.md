# EpInt_Stress

You can find the data I worked with in the file "Data.xlsx" and follow my analyses and figures in the file "Analyses_RScript.R". 

The raw log files of the narrative-insight task can be found in "Logs.zip".

The multiple condition files (MCF files) can be found by the prefix "MCF..." to get the names, start and duration.

For my fMRI analyses, I used the files "Preprocessing_Pipeline.m", "First_Level_Mismatch" (for the link-phase analyses), "First_Level_Univariate" (for the pre- and post-changes), "First_Level_RSA" (for the RSA analysis). The second level files will be made available on NeuroVault upon publication. 

To further reproduce my RSA results, you can use my RDMs in the file "RDMs.zip" and "Get_Averaged_RSA_Results.m".
To get the RDMs, I used "ROI_RSA_AMG.m" and the files in "rsatoolbox.zip".
